many modern programming thecniques and procedures.
leo is a programming language very similar to the language called "lua".

LEO differs from Lua above all in its nature of a language dedicated 
to hobby or professional training and work. The language has its source 
files which are well commented, its syntax is classic but modern at the 
same time and has very fast execution times, 
thanks to its compiler which is no larger than 300-400 Kbytes.
