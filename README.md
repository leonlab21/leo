# LEO is a programming language. LEO is a part of the Project LEONLAB21.
The source code is cintaimed only by files whith the .leo as the file type and no other extentionâ€™s type is required: also the code or a part of it, another language syntax like C or C++ is writed. this occur because the execution of the created program start from the src/ repository wo .leo files are saved.
leo is a programming language very similar to the language called "lua". 
For more information about Lua see the website https://www.lua.org. 
LEO differs from Lua above all in its nature of a language dedicated 
to hobby or professional training and work. The language has its source 
files which are well commented, its syntax is classic but modern at the 
same time and has very fast execution times, 
thanks to its compiler which is no larger than 300-400 Kbytes.
